# Knuckle-Joint

Knuckle Joint Design AI/ML Web App
An interactive web application for engineering students and professionals to automate the design, analysis, and safety assessment of knuckle joints using machine learning (AIML) techniques.

🟢 Features
Generate large customized datasets for knuckle joint design in CSV format

Upload your CSV for AI-based training and prediction of design dimensions

Auto-calculates rod diameter, pin diameter, eye/fork/head dimensions from load, yield strength, and factor of safety

Predicts whether the design is SAFE or NOT SAFE for the given conditions

Modern, responsive HTML/CSS (Bootstrap) user interface—no coding required

Built with Python (Flask), pandas, scikit-learn, and Bootstrap

🔍 Use Cases
Educational: Visualize the impact of design variables on safety and dimensions in mechanical engineering coursework

Project: Quickly generate and test thousands of design cases for project/research purposes

Demo: Showcase practical AIML integration in engineering design problems

🚀 How It Works
Generate a 10,000-row engineering dataset (auto-download CSV)

Upload your CSV file for model training

Enter design parameters to predict key dimensions and safety

Instantly see results and safety status in an intuitive web UI

📦 Technologies
Python 3, Flask, pandas, scikit-learn

Bootstrap 5 HTML/CSS
